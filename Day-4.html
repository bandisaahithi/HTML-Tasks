        In this blog, I will share you how to make <b>Cafe Style Chocolate Brownie Recipe</b> | <b>Best Fudgy Cocoa Brownies.</b>  There are many varieties of Brownies. This is a simple basic Chocolate Brownie. This recipe will give you Brownies that are crispy on the top and sides and also moist enough to melt in your mouth. It tastes exactly like the Chocolate Brownies you get in Cafes.

        <dt><b>My Experience with Brownie</b></dt> <br>
        <dd>Brownies are easy to make if you know the technique. But the measurements should be accurate, and they should be baked at just the right temperature.If you don't get either of these right, then the Brownies will not turn out well. I tried and <b>failed</b> to make good Brownies many times.</dd> <br>

        <dd>To tell you honestly, I neither got the taste nor the shape of the original Brownie. But when I had attended a buffet dinner at a star hotel in Hyderabad, I met the baker there and asked him to explain what I was doing wrong.And with the help of tips given by <b>Chef Sushanta</b>, I learned to make <b>perfect Brownies.</b></dd> <br>
</dl>
    <strong>
        Some important Tips to follow:
    </strong>
    <ol>
        <li>I have used a <strong>9 x 9-inch</strong> mould. You could use a <strong>12 x 12-inch </strong>mould for Cafe style Brownies.</li> <br>

        <li>If you keep all the ingredients ready and start <strong>preheating</strong> the Oven, and then start mixing, the Oven will be ready by the time the mixing is done.</li> <br>

        <li>The Oven <strong>starts to cool down</strong> once preheating is over. Therefore, the Brownie mould has to be kept inside immediately. Only then we will get perfect Brownies.</li> <br>
        <li>Every Oven works differently. So, it is always better to bake until you <strong>poke a toothpick in the centre of the Brownie</strong>, and it comes out clean.</li> <br>
        <li>The Chocolate flavour gets emphasized if you add a <strong>spoon of Coffee Decoction</strong> to the Brownie. I haven't counted but you could try if you like.</li> <br>
        <li>Heat <b>Dark Chocolate for 10 seconds</b>  in the Oven, mix and heat for another 10 seconds. <strong>Do it again for another 10 seconds</strong>, and then it melts nicely for the Brownie.</li><br>
        <li>If the Chocolate mould is kept directly on the stove, the Chocolate burns. That is why it needs to be melted by a <strong>double broiler method</strong> or in an open Oven.</li> <br>
