    <p>"They are being trained on aero-medical aspects, recovery and survival procedures in addition to academic courses on Gaganyaan flight systems," an ISRO official told news agency PTI. "Training modules also include physical fitness, simulator training and spacesuit familiarization."</p>

    <p>The mission-specific preparations commenced after the four astronauts completed their general spaceflight training in Russia at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.</p>

    <p>As per ISRO sources, the current training curriculum consists of over 200 specialised lectures by ISRO scientists and Indian Institute of Science faculty. The crew has also gone through 75 fitness sessions and 12 hours of flying practices besides medical checkups and progress evaluations.</p>
